### Pool Metadata
Pool Metadata is an open source tool designed to provide additional insights into pool types and compositions on Balancer. It aims to serve as a comprehensive and convenient way for pool owners to add metadata such as name, symbol, description, links, logos, and more to their pools. This tool is not exclusive to Balancer's front-end; any team building on Balancer (e.g., Fjord, Xave, Copper, etc) can consume the data and display it on their own UIs.

You can also add predefined attributes to your pool. These attributes are pre-filled and you will need to add the values for them. For example, if you want to add a `website` attribute, you can select it from the dropdown and add the website URL in the value field.
